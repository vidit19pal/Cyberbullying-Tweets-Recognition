# Cyberbullying-Tweets-Recognition
As social media usage becomes increasingly prevalent in every age group, a vast majority of citizens rely on this essential medium for day-today communication. Social mediaâ€™s ubiquity means that cyberbullying can effectively impact anyone at any time or anywhere, and the relative anonymity of the internet makes such personal attacks more difficult to stop than traditional bullying.
On April 15th, 2020, UNICEF issued a warning in response to the increased risk of cyberbullying during the COVID-19 pandemic due to widespread school closures, increased screen time, and decreased face-to-face social interaction. The statistics of cyberbullying are outright alarming: 36.5% of middle and high school students have felt cyberbullied and 87% have observed cyberbullying, with effects ranging from decreased academic performance to depression to suicidal thoughts.
The objective of this NLP based project is to create a model that can automatically flag potentially harmful tweets as well as break down the patterns of hatred.
It is the case of multi-classification with target variable "Cyberbullying_type" having six labels as Age, Ethnicity, Gender, Religion, Other type of cyberbullying, Not cyberbullying. 
Algorithms used are TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost. The best prforming model is SVC (Support Vector Classifier) with accuracy score of 84%.
